You'll hear me say, "Design is my life".

I like to fantasize this is my calling. 

Though, I can't reasonably believe my serendipitous involvement in design.

Long story short, After high school I was spent few months in Montreal, working (hardly) and doing Kung Fu (obsessively). August comes along and mum suggests I try the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design (NBCCD). A small technical college in my hometown. And at the time, one of my life goals was to become a better artist. So I said "sure", very causally. The idea of a profession in the arts, or anything relating to that college was nonexistent. 

<b>Year 1</b>, didn't take it very seriously. The Foundation Visual Arts Certificate Program (1 year program). I hated writing papers, enjoyed drawing, in and outside of class. Most importantly, this is where I learnt that there are in fact professions in art, craft and design. I seriously had next to no idea. I've never really thought about before.

<b>Year 2</b> comes around and I chose to pursue graphic design in the Graphic Design Diploma Program (2 year program). I chose this program because I liked drawing and because job placement would be easier than the alternatives (sorry potters). 

This is where I realized was dispositioned to graphic design. I excelled and enjoyed feeling above my class. So I tried even harder and kept things serious (too serious, sometimes). As opposed to my first year marks (C - B - A range), this time I only made A's. Side note: I don't mean to boast, these are facts and of which all are part of my path to where I am today.

<b>Year 3</b> was basically an expansion on year 2, with a drive to create effective (not only sexy) work. My ego was on high at this point (justifiably, I was a kid). Naive enough to graduate thinking I could freelance my way to the top! The spirit of entrepreneuship and/or simply running my own ship never ceased to interest me. The young and naive fantasy of being self employed.

<b>Year 4</b> I worked at an agency, designing and building wordpress websites for 8 months before breakding down crying in front of my boss, unexpectedly. We were both shocked. Soon after, confessing that I've been doing freelance work with the company laptop. And soon after, my letter of resignation. We've mixed feelings, but above all, I will forever appreciate everything they've done for me. 

I went to work "part/full-time" for a startup (which I've worked for/with on and off since summer of Year 2). 2 Months later, that doesn't work out. I then jump on a train to Toronto to visit my beloved, with a stop in between to attend Startup Weekend Ottawa. Met Adrian Seeley who later leads me to a full-time startup gig (Hive, a.k.a. Nu Messenger) in Montreal, going through <a href="http://founderfuel.com/en/" target="_blank">FounderFuel</a>.

<b>Year 5</b> begins with the failure of Hive. Then immediately get picked up by another startup (<a href="https://www.selectivefew.com/" target="_blank">Selective Few</a>), full-time, nice salary, cool guys, also hailing from FounderFuel. 7 months later: company folds, relationship ends and on a flight to Asia for 6 weeks.
